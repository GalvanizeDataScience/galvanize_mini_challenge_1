# Galvanize DSI Entrance Mini-challenge

The world of Data Science is ever-changing and very complex. At Galvanize, there is not enough time to teach _everything_
a Data Scientist might use in their job (although we do teach A LOT of it). Even if we _could_ teach everything that a modern
Data Scientist would use on-the-job, the world will quickly change and every successful Data Scientist will need to constantly
learn the _newest_ tools and techniques throughout the rest of their career.

As such, the ability to learn new tools and techniques is paramount to your success both in our Data Science Immersive _and_ in your career as a Data Scientist. The goal of this challenge is to assess your ability to learn quickly. The challenge below is relatively simple but will require that you do your own research (Google is your friend) to figure out how to use Pandas, Matplotlib, and how to compute various statistics (presumably new technologies for you).

1. Download the dataset of [Job Titles and Salaries](./data/salary_take_home.csv).
2. Compute the mean salary of the whole dataset.
3. Compute the mean salary of Police Officers.
4. Find the four Job Titles with the highest average salaries.
5. Compute a 95% confidence interval around the mean salary of the whole dataset.
6. Create a boxplot showing the distribution of salaries in the whole dataset.

Submit a single Jupyter notebook containing organized answers for the prompts above. Write Markdown in the notebook to organize your code and communicate your intent to the reader.
